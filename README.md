Face Detection using OpenCV 📸
This repository contains a simple face detection system built using OpenCV and Python. The system uses a Haar cascade classifier to detect faces in real-time video feed from a webcam.

Features 🤖
- Real-time face detection using OpenCV's Haar cascade classifier
- Uses webcam feed to detect faces
- Draws rectangles around detected faces

Requirements 📋
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV

How it Works 🤔
1. The code initializes a Haar cascade classifier for face detection.
2. It captures video feed from the webcam.
3. Each frame is converted to grayscale and faces are detected using the classifier.
4. Rectangles are drawn around detected faces.

Usage 📚
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install OpenCV if not already installed.
3. Run the code using python face_detection.py.
4. Press Esc to exit the program.

Future Work 🔜
- Improve face detection accuracy
- Add more features such as facial recognition or emotion detection
